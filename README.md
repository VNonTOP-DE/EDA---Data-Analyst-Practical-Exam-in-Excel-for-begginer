Step-by-step guide: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Practice
Step 1: Open Your Data in Excel or Google Sheets

Open Excel or Google Sheets.

Download sample dataset provided, go to File > Import in Google Sheets or File > Open in Excel and upload it.

Step 2: Get Familiar with the Dataset

Take a moment to look over the dataset. Notice the columns, rows, and types of data. Here’s what each column represents:

Customer ID: A unique number identifying each customer.

Customer Age: The age of each customer.

Region: The location of each customer.

Product Type: The type of product purchased.

Purchase Amount: The amount spent on each purchase.

Satisfaction Rating: How satisfied each customer was with their purchase.

Understanding these elements will help you make sense of the data.

Step 3: Filter Data to Identify Segments

Filtering allows you to focus on specific parts of the data, like a certain region or product type.

In Excel:

Select your data range (click and drag over all cells or press Ctrl + A).

Go to the Data tab and select Filter.

Click the arrow next to the column you want to filter (e.g., “Region”) and select one or more specific values (like “North”).

In Google Sheets:

Select your data range.

Go to Data > Create a filter.

Click the filter icon on the column you want to filter, and choose the values you want to view.

Example Task: Filter the data to only show customers in the “North” region. This way, you can explore what these customers are buying and how much they’re spending.

Step 4: Sort Data to See Rankings and Patterns

Sorting helps you find high and low values quickly, like the highest or lowest purchase amounts.

In Excel:

Select a column to sort, such as “Purchase Amount.”

Go to the Data tab and choose Sort A to Z (lowest to highest) or Sort Z to A (highest to lowest).

In Google Sheets:

Click on the column letter for the column you want to sort.

Right-click and select Sort sheet A-Z or Sort sheet Z-A.

Example Task: Sort “Purchase Amount” from highest to lowest to see which customers are spending the most.

Step 5: Group and Summarize Data

Grouping lets you combine data by categories, like grouping by “Region” or “Product Type.” Then, you can calculate averages, counts, or totals to get a summary.

In Excel:

Select your data range.

Go to Insert > PivotTable and click OK to create a pivot table.

Drag “Region” to Rows and “Purchase Amount” to Values. This will give you the total amount spent per region.

To see averages, click on the value field in the PivotTable, go to Value Field Settings, and select Average.

In Google Sheets:

Select your data range.

Go to Data > Pivot table.

In the pivot table editor, add “Region” as Rows and “Purchase Amount” as Values to see totals by region.

Example Task: Group by “Product Type” to see the average purchase amount per product type. This shows you which product categories have higher average spending.

Step 6: Visualize Data with Charts

Charts make it easy to see patterns, relationships, and trends in your data.

Creating a Histogram (Customer Age Distribution)

A histogram shows the distribution of values, like how many customers are in each age group.

In Excel:

Select the “Customer Age” column.

Go to Insert > Histogram Chart.

Adjust the chart as needed to see age distribution.

In Google Sheets:

Select the “Customer Age” column.

Go to Insert > Chart, then choose Histogram from the chart types.

Example Task: Look at the histogram of “Customer Age” to see which age groups are most common among customers.

Creating a Scatter Plot (Relationship Between Age and Purchase Amount)

A scatter plot shows relationships between two variables.

In Excel:

Select both the “Customer Age” and “Purchase Amount” columns.

Go to Insert > Scatter Plot.

Adjust the chart to see if there’s a relationship between age and spending.

In Google Sheets:

Select both columns (hold Ctrl or Command to select them).

Go to Insert > Chart and choose Scatter Plot.

Example Task: Use the scatter plot to explore whether age impacts spending. Look for any trend, like older customers spending more.

Step 7: Identify Outliers and Patterns

Outliers are values that don’t fit the general pattern. These can reveal interesting insights or show data errors.

Example Task: Look at the scatter plot. Do any points stand out far from the others? For instance, a customer with a very high purchase amount compared to others may represent an outlier.

Step 8: Document Your Findings

Take notes on what you discover during your EDA practice:

What are the most common customer ages?

Which region has the highest purchase amounts?

Are there any patterns between product type and satisfaction rating?

Recording these insights prepares you for the next stage of analysis.

Step 9: Reflect on What You Learned

Reflect on how filtering, sorting, grouping, and visualizing data helped you uncover insights that weren’t obvious before. Understanding the data structure, seeing patterns, and spotting outliers are essential skills that make EDA so valuable.

What did you find surprising in the data?

How could these insights be useful in real business scenarios?

What would you do next if you wanted to analyze this data further?

Summary of Key EDA Techniques

Filtering: Focus on specific data segments.

Sorting: Rank data to find high and low values.

Grouping & Summarizing: Aggregate data by categories for insights.

Visualization: Use histograms, scatter plots, and other charts to see patterns.

Practicing EDA will give you a solid foundation for analyzing data, helping you make smarter, data-informed decisions. Enjoy exploring your dataset!
